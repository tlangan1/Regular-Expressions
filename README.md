# Regular Expressions Tutorial Application

Author: Tom Langan

This repo contains an application to help learn about regular expressions as implemented in JavaScript.

## Features

The application contains an introduction with some links to various resources. It also contains four articles briefly covering assertions, character classes, groups and ranges and quantifiers. Finally it contains a page containing several examples of regular expressions.

The application contains a side panel that the user can use to experiment with regular expressions.

There are several canned examples of regular expressions sprinkled throughout the articles that can be displayed in the side panel with which the user can interact.

## TODOs

1. Populate the miscellaneous examples drop-down from the title property of the array that defines the examples.
1. add default options to the examples data structure to allow for default case sensitivity and default dotall.
1. Enhance the application to allow the user to save their own regular expressions. Possibly use Web Storage API for this.
1. Replace the navigation section at the top with an MDN like structure
