            A regular expression is a sequence of characters that specifies a
            search pattern in text.
          </p>
          <p>
            Is there a way to negate an entire regex?

            there is not.

            but I am not sure it is entirey accurate. The highest weighted
            answer suggests the negative lookaround: (?!pattern).

          <ul>
            <li>
              "^" matches the beginning of input. The pattern to match must
              appear
              <u>after</u> the caret symbol as in "^a".
              <p>
                If the multiline flag, '/m', is used, then it also applies
                immediately <u>after</u> a line break. Note that the caret
                symbol, '^', means negation when used at the start of a range.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              "$" matches the end of input. The pattern to match must appear
              <u>before</u>
              the caret symbol as in "a$".
              <p>
                If the multiline flag, "/m", is used, then it also applies
                immediately <u>before</u> a line break.

            <li>
              "\b" matches a word boundary. This is the position where a word
              character is not followed or preceded by another word-character.
              <p>
                To be precise, \b[pattern] will match a word starting pattern
                whereas [pattern]\b will match a word ending pattern
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              "\B" matches a non-word boundary. This is a position where the
              previous and next character are of the same type: Either both must
              be words, or both must be non-words.
              <p>
                To be precise, \B[pattern] will require that the beginning of
                the pattern be at a non-word boudary whereas [pattern]\B will
                require that the end of the pattern be at a non-word boundary.

              ES2018 added the "\s", "dotAll", flag, which allows the dot to

              \ indicates that the following character should be treated

                  For characters that are usually treated literally, indicates

                <li>

              "x" 0 or more times. One might conclude that x* will match
              everything because of the "zero" reference, but that is not the
              case. The "zero" reference only makes sense in the context of a
              larger item. "Zero" or more relative to a larger context.
